# Groupchat-python-sockets
Implementation of a chatroom with multi peer handling in python with sockets

This is a chatroom created in python, this allows users to chat on a local network. I will update this to work on global network. This code needs 'tkinter' module as it uses GUI created in tkinter.


i will update this with:

**TODO**
* Global Network Communication
* Update GUI design
* Encryption of Messages
* Local Storage of Message
* Peer to Peer Communication
* Create account for each user
